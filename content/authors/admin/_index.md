I am an associate professor of Instructional Technology at Georgia Southern University, Leadership, Technology, and Human Development Department.

My research focuses on designing innovative and technology-rich learning environments to teach young children important higher-order thinking skills. An example of this work is Game Design and Learning (GDL) courses that I initiated and ran in both the US and Istanbul, Turkey. The results of this work can be found on the publications page.

Currently, I am teaching Educational Psychology and Instructional Technology courses at the online Instructional Technology master's program at Georgia Southern University.
